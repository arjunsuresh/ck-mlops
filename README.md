## Current projects
* Developing a platform to automate SW/HW co-design for ML Systems across diverse models, data sets, frameworks and platforms based on user constraints in terms of speed, accuracy, energy and costs: [OctoML.ai](https://OctoML.ai) & [cKnowledge.io](https://cKnowledge.io)
* [Automating MLPerf(tm) inference benchmark and packing ML models, data sets and frameworks as CK components with a unified API and meta description](https://github.com/mlcommons/ck/blob/master/docs/mlperf-automation/README.md)
* Providing a common format to share artifacts at ML, systems and other conferences: [video](https://youtu.be/DIkZxraTmGM), [Artifact Evaluation](https://cTuning.org/ae)
* Redesigning CK together with the community based on user feedback
* [Other real-world use cases](https://cKnowledge.org/partners.html) from MLPerf&trade;, Qualcomm, Arm, General Motors, IBM, the Raspberry Pi foundation, ACM and other great partners;
